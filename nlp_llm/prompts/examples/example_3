    "summary": "We will address the topic of the creation of small black holes during particle collisions in a ground-based accelerator, such as LHC. The most important observable effect associated with their creation is likely to be the emission of Hawking radiation during their evaporation process. We will finish with a discussion of the methodology that will be used to study these spectra."
