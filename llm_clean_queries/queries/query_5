I have been exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare, focusing on the development of machine learning models for disease prediction and early diagnosis. Additionally, I am interested in understanding how wearable technologies and patient-generated health data can improve personalized medicine and how ethical considerations shape the adoption of AI-driven solutions in clinical practice.
