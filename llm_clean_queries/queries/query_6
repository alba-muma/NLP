I have been exploring the intersection of renewable energy and economics, focusing on the development of strategies for optimizing energy production and distribution in smart grids. Additionally, I am interested in understanding how policy incentives and market dynamics influence the adoption of sustainable energy solutions and how emerging technologies, such as energy storage systems, impact global energy transitions.
