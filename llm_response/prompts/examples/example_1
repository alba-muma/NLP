        "summary": "The support vector machine and the AdaBoost algorithm have spawned a wave of research in statistical machine learning. Much of this new research falls into one of two broad categories: kernel methods and ensemble methods. I present two recent algorithms that I have invented with my collaborators: LAGO, a fast kernel algorithm for unbalanced classification and rare target detection."
